# Rerender a React Application

- html을 변경하는 방식 말고, ReactDom 을 이용하면 변화되는 곳만 리렌더링이 일어난다. 
- 성능 개선 및 최적화에 좋다.
- Updating the DOM is typically the slowest part of the whole process. React only updates what’s necessary.
- React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
- When we re-render the entire app with setInterval you can see the clock changes without a browser window refresh.
- Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets updated by React DOM.
