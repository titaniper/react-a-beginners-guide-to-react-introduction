# Make HTTP Requests with React

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API (익스플로어 작동 안함)
- HTTP 통신은 request 뿐 아니라, 부작용도 있음으로 in flight 상황에서 유저에게 표시해야 하는 상황도 관리해야 한다.

> Most useful React applications involve interacting with a server to load and persist data. To do this on the web, we use HTTP requests with the browser’s built-in fetch API (or you may use some other open source library that’s built on top of this API). HTTP requests like this are inherently asynchronous in nature and they’re also side-effects so we’ll need to manage not only starting the request, but also what we should show the user while the request is “in flight.”

> In this lesson we’ll use a public GraphQL server that serves up pokemon data to load information for a given pokemon name. We’ll learn how to fetch that data inside a React.useEffect callback and display the results when the request completes.
