# Manipulate the DOM with React refs

- 떄떄로 외부 라이브러리에 접근해야 할 경우가 있다. 이때 ref를 사용하자
- 메모리 릭이 발생할 수 있는 경우 무조건 메모리에서 해제해줘야 한다.

> React is really good at creating and updating DOM elements, but sometimes you need to work with them yourself. A common use case for this is when you’re using a third party library that wasn’t built for or with React specifically. To do this, we need to have some value that’s associated with our component (like state) to store a reference to the DOM element, but doesn’t trigger re-renders when it’s updated (unlike state). React has something specifically for this and it’s called a ref.

> You create a ref object with the useRef hook and that object’s current property is the current value of the ref. It can be anything, but if you pass that ref object to a component as a prop called ref, then React will set the current property to the DOM element it creates so you can reference it and manipulate it in your useEffect hook.

> In this lesson we’ll get to see how that works with a cool library called vanilla-tilt.
